##The code as you are seeing right now is only a part of our project.##


The code for our project in eclipse is only for the searching, sorting and graphing algorithm,
and they can be run individually in eclipse. However, if you run the code in eclipse only,
you cannot get the full version of our project, please extract the folder "Group12_FinalProject(android)"
in our final project submission folder, and follow the instruction we included in a docx file called "Readme.docx"

By following the instruction we included in "Readme.docx" in our "Group12_FinalProject(android)" folder and by running the entire project
in "Group12_FinalProject(android)" in Android Studio, you can get the desired output of our project.


Because of our project is developed based on android platform, you can also install the apk file in "Group12_FinalProject(android)" on
any Android devices. To get the best experience of our project, we suggest you run our project on a android device which has OS version 7.0
or above.
